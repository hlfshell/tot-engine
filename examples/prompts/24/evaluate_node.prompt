Evaluate if given numbers can reach 24 (definite/likely/impossible)
10 14
10 + 14 = 24
Reasoning: I can reach 24
Rating: definite
11 12
11 + 12 = 23
12 - 11 = 1
11 * 12 = 132
11 / 12 = 0.91
Reasoning: I can't reach 24 with any operation
Rating: impossible
4 4 10
4 + 4 + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18
4 * 10 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
(10 - 4) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24
Reasoning: I have reached 24 with a set of operations
Rating: definite
4 9 11
9 + 11 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24
Reasoning: I reached 24 with addition
Rating: definite
5 7 8
5 + 7 + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20
(8 - 5) * 7 = 3 * 7 = 21
Reasoning: I cannot obtain 24 now, but numbers are within a reasonable range
Rating: likely
5 6 6
5 + 6 + 6 = 17
(6 - 5) * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6
Reasoning: I cannot obtain 24 now, but numbers are within a reasonable range
Rating: likely
10 10 11
10 + 10 + 11 = 31
(11 - 10) * 10 = 10
Reasoning: 10 10 10 are all too big
Rating: impossible
1 3 3
1 * 3 * 3 = 9
(1 + 3) * 3 = 12
Reasoning: 1 3 3 are all too small
Rating: impossible
